In particular, we define a procedure for\nturning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a\nsequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM\nis a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural\nequations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational,\ninterventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired\ncausal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of\nbenchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level\ncounterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional\nrelationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of\nthousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these\ndatasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect\nestimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating\ndata, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal\neffect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing\nLLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We\nbelieve SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would\nbenefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.\n","authors":["Lucius E. J.

This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies\nanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of\nyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally\nwell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be\nformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of\nprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of\nregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same\npredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically\nEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We\nintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:\nfocusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and\nanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a\nset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct\nconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and\nanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives\nwith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable\nnominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.\nFurthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,\neven for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical\naccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the\nhypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization\ninvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the\nunderlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes\nplay a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously\nthought.\n","authors":["Valentin Hofmann","Leonie Weissweiler","David Mortensen","Hinrich Schütze","Janet Pierrehumbert"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07990v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07975v1","updated":"2024-11-12T17:55:10Z","published":"2024-11-12T17:55:10Z","title":"JanusFlow: Harmonizing Autoregression and Rectified Flow for Unified\n  Multimodal Understanding and Generation","summary":"  We present JanusFlow, a powerful framework that unifies image understanding\nand generation in a single model.

This work\naddresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during\npretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics\nof factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively,\nwe observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in\nthe model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge.

Third, training LLMs with\nlarger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. Overall,\nour observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining\noccurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge\npresented in the pretraining data at each step.

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nhave made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page\ndocument understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain\nan open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context,\nmulti-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct\nfrom previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted\ndocuments with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards\ncomprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence\nfrom (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure)\nand (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions\nare cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the\nquestions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential\nhallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU\ngreatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o,\nachieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores\n31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse\nperformance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR\ndocuments.

As models scale, compression techniques become essential for\nbalancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning,\nwhich removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy\nfor reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant\nquality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To\nrecover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it\ncan lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data\ndistribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT\nis essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize\nself-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach\nleverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that\npreserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by\nmaintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT,\nimproving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard\nv1.

Such proposed\napproaches should ideally process multiple types of data, including time\nseries, audio, satellite images, and video, near the network edge as multiple\ndata streams has been shown to improve the discriminative ability of learning\nalgorithms, especially for generating fine grained results. Incidentally, there\nhas been recent work on data driven conditional computation of subnetworks that\nhas shown real progress in using a single model to share parameters among very\ndifferent types of inputs such as images and text, reducing the computation\nrequirement of multi-tower multimodal networks. Inspired by such line of work,\nwe explore similar per patch conditional computation for the first time for\nmobile vision transformers (vision only case), that will eventually be used for\nsingle-tower multimodal edge models. We evaluate the model on Cornell Sap\nSucker Woods 60, a fine grained bird species discrimination dataset.

Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is\nexpected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is\nchallenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the\ndegree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce\nL4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves\nLiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and\nForeground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is\nthe first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and\n4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 )\nparallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion\n(MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under\nadverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with\nsimulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather\nconditions.

To\naddress these issues, we first design a multi-modal complementary fusion module\nto extract robust multi-modal semantic features by integrating information from\nvisible and thermal or depth image pairs.

We formalize\nthis via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the\ngenerator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of\n\"complexity\" correspond to different $n$.

Potato yield can be estimated on a harvester using an\nRGB-D camera that can estimate the three-dimensional (3D) volume of individual\npotato tubers. A challenge, however, is that the 3D shape derived from RGB-D\nimages is only partially completed, underestimating the actual volume. To\naddress this issue, we developed a 3D shape completion network, called CoRe++,\nwhich can complete the 3D shape from RGB-D images. CoRe++ is a deep learning\nnetwork that consists of a convolutional encoder and a decoder. The encoder\ncompresses RGB-D images into latent vectors that are used by the decoder to\ncomplete the 3D shape using the deep signed distance field network (DeepSDF).\nTo evaluate our CoRe++ network, we collected partial and complete 3D point\nclouds of 339 potato tubers on an operational harvester in Japan. On the 1425\nRGB-D images in the test set (representing 51 unique potato tubers), our\nnetwork achieved a completion accuracy of 2.8 mm on average. For volumetric\nestimation, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 22.6 ml, and this was better\nthan the RMSE of the linear regression (31.1 ml) and the base model (36.9 ml).\nWe found that the RMSE can be further reduced to 18.2 ml when performing the 3D\nshape completion in the center of the RGB-D image. With an average 3D shape\ncompletion time of 10 milliseconds per tuber, we can conclude that CoRe++ is\nboth fast and accurate enough to be implemented on an operational harvester for\nhigh-throughput potato yield estimation. CoRe++'s high-throughput and accurate\nprocessing allows it to be applied to other tuber, fruit and vegetable crops,\nthereby enabling versatile, accurate and real-time yield monitoring in\nprecision agriculture.

According to this new perspective, we can control and gain more\ninformation along the conditional direction in the generation space. Thus, we\npropose the upper bound of the Fisher information to reformulate the\nconditional term, which increases the information gain and decreases the time\ncost. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed FICD can offer up\nto 2x speed-ups under the same sampling steps as most baselines.

It is essential to model both item content and user-item collaborative\ninteractions in a unified generative framework for better recommendation.\nAlthough some existing large language model (LLM)-based methods contribute to\nfusing content information and collaborative signals, they fundamentally rely\non textual language generation, which is not fully aligned with the\nrecommendation task. How to integrate content knowledge and collaborative\ninteraction signals in a generative framework tailored for item recommendation\nis still an open research challenge.\n  In this paper, we propose content-based collaborative generation for\nrecommender systems, namely ColaRec. ColaRec is a sequence-to-sequence\nframework which is tailored for directly generating the recommended item\nidentifier. Precisely, the input sequence comprises data pertaining to the\nuser's interacted items, and the output sequence represents the generative\nidentifier (GID) for the suggested item. To model collaborative signals, the\nGIDs are constructed from a pretrained collaborative filtering model, and the\nuser is represented as the content aggregation of interacted items. To this\nend, ColaRec captures both collaborative signals and content information in a\nunified framework. Then an item indexing task is proposed to conduct the\nalignment between the content-based semantic space and the interaction-based\ncollaborative space. Besides, a contrastive loss is further introduced to\nensure that items with similar collaborative GIDs have similar content\nrepresentations. To verify the effectiveness of ColaRec, we conduct experiments\non four benchmark datasets.

This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies\nanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of\nyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally\nwell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be\nformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of\nprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of\nregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same\npredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically\nEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We\nintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:\nfocusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and\nanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a\nset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct\nconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and\nanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives\nwith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable\nnominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.\nFurthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,\neven for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical\naccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the\nhypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization\ninvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the\nunderlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes\nplay a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously\nthought.\n","authors":["Valentin Hofmann","Leonie Weissweiler","David Mortensen","Hinrich Schütze","Janet Pierrehumbert"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07990v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02271v2","updated":"2024-11-12T18:11:30Z","published":"2024-11-04T17:03:52Z","title":"On the Utilization of Unique Node Identifiers in Graph Neural Networks","summary":"  Graph Neural Networks have inherent representational limitations due to their\nmessage-passing structure.

It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour\narises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or\ninstead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\\ Kronecker) approximations used\nor any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates.

To address these issues, we\npropose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the\nconditional expected outcomes.

We formalize\nthis via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the\ngenerator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of\n\"complexity\" correspond to different $n$.

This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental\nmodules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information\nsharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These\nmodules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge\nlearning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is\ninterdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and\nbandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation\n(ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge,\nbut they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To\novercome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that\ncomprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This\nintegrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and\nComputation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task\nperformance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and\nrelated techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations.

We prove that particular\narchitectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which\ndegrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance.\nBased on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the\nsuppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free\nproxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art\nproxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation\ntime reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS\nwith state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with\nhigher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical\nanalyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the\nsuppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal\narchitectures in Zero-Shot NAS.\n","authors":["Ning Wu","Han Huang","Yueting Xu","Zhifeng Hao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06236v2.pdf","comment":"8 pages, 2 figures.

Broadly, the goal is to estimate differences in event rates under\ntwo treatments within a defined target population over a specified followup\nwindow. Estimation with observational data is challenging because, while\nmembership in the target population is defined in terms of eligibility\ncriteria, treatment is rarely observed exactly at the time of eligibility.\nAd-hoc solutions to this timing misalignment can induce bias by incorrectly\nattributing prior event counts and person-time to treatment. Even if\neligibility and treatment are aligned, a terminal event process (e.g. death)\noften stops the recurrent event process of interest. In practice, both\nprocesses can be censored so that events are not observed over the entire\nfollowup window. Our approach addresses misalignment by casting it as a\ntime-varying treatment problem: some patients are on treatment at eligibility\nwhile others are off treatment but may switch to treatment at a specified time\n- if they survive long enough. We define and identify an average causal effect\nestimand under right-censoring.

In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England).

An intelligent system should perform set operations\nconsistently, regardless of superficial variations in the operands. Initially\ndesigned for semantically-oriented NLP tasks, large language models (LLMs) are\nnow being evaluated on algorithmic tasks. Because sets are comprised of\narbitrary symbols (e.g. numbers, words), they provide an opportunity to test,\nsystematically, the invariance of LLMs' algorithmic abilities under simple\nlexical or semantic variations. To this end, we present the SetLexSem\nChallenge, a synthetic benchmark that evaluates the performance of LLMs on set\noperations. SetLexSem assesses the robustness of LLMs' instruction-following\nabilities under various conditions, focusing on the set operations and the\nnature and construction of the set members. Evaluating seven LLMs with\nSetLexSem, we find that they exhibit poor robustness to variation in both\noperation and operands.

The ACR overcomes the\nlimitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial\nview of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and\ncompliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for\narbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute.

It can minimize cyber attacks and\nprevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular\ninterest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of\nrecognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this\nwork, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize\nsuch patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP\nbenchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization.\nBERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot\nbe directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to\nrecognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords\nand character-level information and can be an alternative solution.\nNotwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD\nas they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information\n(e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose\nTempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information\nin the embedding layer of CharBERT.

Previous work has primarily\nrelied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or\nmanipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to intervene on\nthese models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful\nto examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared\nhad it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We\nhighlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from\ninterventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy.

The attention head can\nsimultaneously delete, copy, or retain tokens by assigning them negative,\npositive, or minimal attention weights, respectively. As a result, a single\nattention head becomes more flexible and expressive. (2) Cog Attention improves\nthe model's robustness against representational collapse, which can occur when\nearlier tokens are over-squashed into later positions, leading to homogeneous\nrepresentations. Negative weights reduce effective information paths from\nearlier to later tokens, helping to mitigate this issue. We develop\nTransformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including\ndecoder-only models for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion models for image\ngeneration.

Therefore, fine-tuning on specialized or new knowledge that\nreflects changes in the world has become popular, though it risks disrupting\nthe model's original capabilities. We study this fragility in the context of\ncontinual memorization, where the model is trained on a small set of long-tail\nfactoids (factual associations) and must retain these factoids after multiple\nstages of subsequent training on other datasets. Through extensive experiments,\nwe show that LLMs suffer from forgetting across a wide range of subsequent\ntasks, and simple replay techniques do not fully prevent forgetting, especially\nwhen the factoid datasets are trained in the later stages. We posit that there\nare two ways to alleviate forgetting: 1) protect the memorization process as\nthe model learns the factoids, or 2) reduce interference from training in later\nstages. With this insight, we develop an effective mitigation strategy: REMIX\n(Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX prevents forgetting by mixing generic\ndata sampled from pretraining corpora or even randomly generated word sequences\nduring each stage, despite being unrelated to the memorized factoids in the\nfirst stage. REMIX can recover performance from severe forgetting, often\noutperforming replay-based methods that have access to the factoids from the\nfirst stage. We then analyze how REMIX alters the learning process and find\nthat successful forgetting prevention is associated with a pattern: the model\nstores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the set of layers\nthat store these factoids. The efficacy of REMIX invites further investigation\ninto the underlying dynamics of memorization and forgetting, opening exciting\npossibilities for future research.\n","authors":["Howard Chen","Jiayi Geng","Adithya Bhaskar","Dan Friedman","Danqi Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07175v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02481v2","updated":"2024-11-11T17:34:00Z","published":"2024-11-04T18:54:39Z","title":"CDR: Customizable Density Ratios of Strong-over-weak LLMs for Preference\n  Annotation","summary":"  Preference tuning of large language models (LLMs) relies on high-quality\nhuman preference data, which is often expensive and time-consuming to gather.\nWhile existing methods can use trained reward models or proprietary model as\njudges for preference annotation, they have notable drawbacks: training reward\nmodels remain dependent on initial human data, and using proprietary model\nimposes license restrictions that inhibits commercial usage.

On Many-Shot In-Context\n  Learning for Long-Context Evaluation","summary":"  Language models (LMs) have demonstrated an improved capacity to handle\nlong-context information, yet existing long-context benchmarks primarily\nmeasure LMs' retrieval abilities with extended inputs, e.g., pinpointing a\nshort phrase from long-form text. Therefore, they may fall short when\nevaluating models' global context understanding capacity, such as synthesizing\nand reasoning over content across input to generate the response. In this\npaper, we study long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot\nin-context learning (ICL). Concretely, we identify the skills each ICL task\nrequires, and examine models' long-context capabilities on them. We first ask:\nWhat types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and are these\ntasks effective at evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and\nsummarization tasks show notable performance improvements with additional\ndemonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear\ntrends. This suggests the classification tasks predominantly test models'\nretrieval skills. Next, we ask: To what extent does each task require retrieval\nskills versus global context understanding from LCLMs? We develop metrics to\ncategorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) retrieval tasks that require strong\nretrieval ability to pinpoint relevant examples, and (ii) global context\nunderstanding tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of the full input.\nWe find that not all datasets can effectively evaluate these long-context\ncapabilities. To address this gap, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark,\nMANYICLBENCH, designed to characterize LCLMs' retrieval and global context\nunderstanding capabilities separately. Benchmarking 11 open-weight LCLMs with\nMANYICLBENCH, we find that while state-of-the-art models perform well in\nretrieval tasks up to 64k tokens, many show significant drops in global context\ntasks at just 16k tokens.\n","authors":["Kaijian Zou","Muhammad Khalifa","Lu Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07130v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07127v1","updated":"2024-11-11T16:58:36Z","published":"2024-11-11T16:58:36Z","title":"Benchmarking LLMs' Judgments with No Gold Standard","summary":"  We introduce the GEM (Generative Estimator for Mutual Information), an\nevaluation metric for assessing language generation by Large Language Models\n(LLMs), particularly in generating informative judgments, without the need for\na gold standard reference.

The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to\nrecognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it\nbelongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy\ntasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or\nsequence-to-sequence transduction. We correct this mismatch by training and\nevaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a\ngeneral method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. As part of\nthis, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\\ae}bjarnarson et al.\n(2024) to do length-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages, with\nmuch better asymptotic time complexity than previous methods.

Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent\nfeature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On\nthe other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the\nsimilarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural\nsparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual\nwords. However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no\nground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex\ndesign to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more\ninterpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for\nboth modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for\nits local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to\nleverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false\ndiscovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation\nfrom falsely frequently activating meaningless words. We demonstrate that these\ntwo pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on the\nmodest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On\ncross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal\ndataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M)\nand those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data,\nincluding CC-12M).

This limitation is only partially addressed by existing\nknowledge distillation techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge\neffectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied\ncapabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of\ninformative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones,\nand the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all\ndevices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique\ncontributions of each. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel\nKD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device\nprototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to\npreserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a\nKD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the\nnoisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process.

Using multiple datasets from more than 3,000 prostate\ncancer patients, we report superior or comparable performance in localising\nradiologist-identified prostate cancer using our proposed T2-only models,\ncompared with alternative models using T2-only or both sequences as input. Real\npatient cases are presented and discussed to demonstrate, for the first time,\nthe exclusively true-positive cases from models with different input sequences.\n","authors":["Weixi Yi","Yipei Wang","Natasha Thorley","Alexander Ng","Shonit Punwani","Veeru Kasivisvanathan","Dean C.

In reality, noisy labels are prevalent,\nposing significant challenges to FL performance. Prior approaches attempt label\ncorrection and robust training techniques but exhibit limited efficacy,\nparticularly under high noise levels. This paper introduces ClipFL (Federated\nLearning Client Pruning), a novel framework addressing noisy labels from a\nfresh perspective. ClipFL identifies and excludes noisy clients based on their\nperformance on a clean validation dataset, tracked using a Noise Candidacy\nScore (NCS). The framework comprises three phases: pre-client pruning to\nidentify potential noisy clients and calculate their NCS, client pruning to\nexclude a percentage of clients with the highest NCS, and post-client pruning\nfor fine-tuning the global model with standard FL on clean clients. Empirical\nevaluation demonstrates ClipFL's efficacy across diverse datasets and noise\nlevels, achieving accurate noisy client identification, superior performance,\nfaster convergence, and reduced communication costs compared to\nstate-of-the-art FL methods.

However,\ncurrent model-based static mesh quality metrics have obvious limitations: most\nof them only consider geometry information, while color information is ignored,\nand they have strict constraints for the meshes' geometrical topology. Other\nmetrics, such as image-based and point-based metrics, are easily influenced by\nthe prepossessing algorithms, e.g., projection and sampling, hampering their\nability to perform at their best. In this paper, we propose Geodesic Patch\nSimilarity (GeodesicPSIM), a novel model-based metric to accurately predict\nhuman perception quality for static meshes. After selecting a group keypoints,\n1-hop geodesic patches are constructed based on both the reference and\ndistorted meshes cleaned by an effective mesh cleaning algorithm. A two-step\npatch cropping algorithm and a patch texture mapping module refine the size of\n1-hop geodesic patches and build the relationship between the mesh geometry and\ncolor information, resulting in the generation of 1-hop textured geodesic\npatches. Three types of features are extracted to quantify the distortion:\npatch color smoothness, patch discrete mean curvature, and patch pixel color\naverage and variance. To the best of our knowledge, GeodesicPSIM is the first\nmodel-based metric especially designed for static meshes with texture maps.\nGeodesicPSIM provides state-of-the-art performance in comparison with\nimage-based, point-based, and video-based metrics on a newly created and\nchallenging database.

In this paper, we proposed the Customizable Recall@N Optimization\nLoss (CROLoss), a loss function that can directly optimize the Recall@N metrics\nand is customizable for different choices of N. This proposed CROLoss\nformulation defines a more generalized loss function space, covering most of\nthe conventional loss functions as special cases. Furthermore, we develop the\nLambda method, a gradient-based method that invites more flexibility and can\nfurther boost the system performance.

While test collections have\nbecome an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves\nsignificant efforts in manual annotations, which often makes it very expensive\nand time-consuming.

As an alternative,\nrecent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to\ncompletely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat\ncorrelate with human judgments, they are not perfect and often show bias.\nMoreover, even if a well-performing LLM or prompt is found on one dataset,\nthere is no guarantee that it will perform similarly in practice, due to\ndifference in tasks and data.

Beyond result-level explanations, model-level\ninterpretations can provide valuable insights that allow developers to optimize\nsystem designs and implement targeted improvements. However, most current\napproaches depend on specialized model designs, which often lack generalization\ncapabilities. Given the various kinds of recommendation models, existing\nmethods have limited ability to effectively interpret them. To address this\nissue, we propose RecSAE, an automatic, generalizable probing method for\ninterpreting the internal states of Recommendation models with Sparse\nAutoEncoder. RecSAE serves as a plug-in module that does not affect original\nmodels during interpretations, while also enabling predictable modifications to\ntheir behaviors based on interpretation results. Firstly, we train an\nautoencoder with sparsity constraints to reconstruct internal activations of\nrecommendation models, making the RecSAE latents more interpretable and\nmonosemantic than the original neuron activations. Secondly, we automated the\nconstruction of concept dictionaries based on the relationship between latent\nactivations and input item sequences. Thirdly, RecSAE validates these\ninterpretations by predicting latent activations on new item sequences using\nthe concept dictionary and deriving interpretation confidence scores from\nprecision and recall. We demonstrate RecSAE's effectiveness on two datasets,\nidentifying hundreds of highly interpretable concepts from pure ID-based\nmodels. Latent ablation studies further confirm that manipulating latent\nconcepts produces corresponding changes in model output behavior, underscoring\nRecSAE's utility for both understanding and targeted tuning recommendation\nmodels.

Explainable Generative Retrieval with Hierarchical\n  Category Paths","summary":"  Generative retrieval has recently emerged as a new alternative of traditional\ninformation retrieval approaches. However, existing generative retrieval\nmethods directly decode docid when a query is given, making it impossible to\nprovide users with explanations as an answer for \"Why this document is\nretrieved?\". To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category\nPath-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by\ngenerating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE\nleverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to\nspecific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for\nthe same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between\nthe query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting\nthe document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE\nconstructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy,\nleverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and\noptimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During\ninference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse\ntopic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in\nthe final ranked list of docids.

The core of their\nefficacy is the ability to explicitly exploit the collaborative signals from\nboth the first- and high-order neighboring nodes. However, most existing\nGCN-based methods overlook the multiple interests of users while performing\nhigh-order graph convolution. Thus, the noisy information from unreliable\nneighbor nodes (e.g., users with dissimilar interests) negatively impacts the\nrepresentation learning of the target node. Additionally, conducting graph\nconvolution operations without differentiating high-order neighbors suffers the\nover-smoothing issue when stacking more layers, resulting in performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we aim to capture more valuable information from\nhigh-order neighboring nodes while avoiding noise for better representation\nlearning of the target node. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel GCN-based\nrecommendation model, termed Cluster-based Graph Collaborative Filtering\n(ClusterGCF).

Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical\ninteractions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target\nresponse and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current\nobjective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for\npersonalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based\nrecommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax\nloss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (S-DPO) to instill ranking\ninformation into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred\nitems from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives.

We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is\nexplicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect\nto the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the\nperformance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA\nsystem that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner\nto infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query.

Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the\nexisting ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in\nindividual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this\nend, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among\nmultiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic\ndata. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines\nand achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human\nannotations.

Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy\nmodels, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been\nrecently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number\nof modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion\nperformance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation.\nDespite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been\nlimited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation:\nusing only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide\nsufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that\nleverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on\nbit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent\nrepresentations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of\ncontexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we\npresent a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing\nthe current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the\nprevious approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance\nimprovements.

One promising use case of this effect would be the\nnonword-to-image generation task which attempts to generate images intuitively\nimaginable from a non-existing word (nonword). To realize nonword-to-image\ngeneration, an existing study focused on associating nonwords with\nsimilar-sounding words. Since each nonword can have multiple similar-sounding\nwords, generating images containing their blended concepts would increase\nintuitiveness, facilitating creative activities and promoting computational\npsycholinguistics. Nevertheless, no existing study has quantitatively evaluated\nthis effect in either diffusion models or the nonword-to-image generation\nparadigm. Therefore, this paper first analyzes the conceptual blending in a\npretrained diffusion model, Stable Diffusion. The analysis reveals that a high\npercentage of generated images depict blended concepts when inputting an\nembedding interpolating between the text embeddings of two text prompts\nreferring to different concepts. Next, this paper explores the best text\nembedding space conversion method of an existing nonword-to-image generation\nframework to ensure both the occurrence of conceptual blending and image\ngeneration quality. We compare the conventional direct prediction approach with\nthe proposed method that combines $k$-nearest neighbor search and linear\nregression. Evaluation reveals that the enhanced accuracy of the embedding\nspace conversion by the proposed method improves the image generation quality,\nwhile the emergence of conceptual blending could be attributed mainly to the\nspecific dimensions of the high-dimensional text embedding space.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

Traditional AFR methods,\nwhich rely on predefined geometric rules and large datasets, are often\ntime-consuming and lack generalizability across various manufacturing features.\nTo address these challenges, this study investigates vision-language models\n(VLMs) for automating the recognition of a wide range of manufacturing features\nin CAD designs without the need for extensive training datasets or predefined\nrules. Instead, prompt engineering techniques, such as multi-view query images,\nfew-shot learning, sequential reasoning, and chain-of-thought, are applied to\nenable recognition. The approach is evaluated on a newly developed CAD dataset\ncontaining designs of varying complexity relevant to machining, additive\nmanufacturing, sheet metal forming, molding, and casting. Five VLMs, including\nthree closed-source models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Claude-3.0-Opus) and\ntwo open-source models (LLava and MiniCPM), are evaluated on this dataset with\nground truth features labelled by experts.

We generate multiple translation\ncandidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently\ntranslate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the\ncycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using\nmetrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the\ntranslation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth.
